# Model Identification

This folder contains several files that were used to store data, identify models, and visualize data.

* `systemID.m` is a MATLAB script that was used to identify linear, time-invariant (LTI) model(s) to be used in simulation and for the control model. 

* `data_view.ipynb` is a Python notebook that may be used to visualize the data collected and the predictions of the models that were created for this work. 

* File(s) that end in `.csv` are raw data files collected by performing open loop experiments on the atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). They are differentiated by the date-time stamp in the filename, which indicate the date/time that the data were collected.

* File(s) that have the pattern `APPJmodel_{datetime}.mat` are saved LTI model(s) generated by running `systemID.m` with the open loop data. The `{datetime}` value corresponds to the date-time stamp of the open loop data file (not when the model was created).
